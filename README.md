## Overview 
Optimize for tomorrow by using forecasting today! The use of a model to predict future values based on values that have already been observed is known as time series forecasting.

It is one of the most important tools for business analysts to use when predicting demand and inventory, budgeting, sales quotas, marketing campaigns, and purchasing. Better decisions are made with accurate forecasts. For forecasting, the current visual uses the well-known exponential smoothing method. Trend and seasonality modeling are the foundations of the prediction. To meet your requirements, you can modify the visual attributes and algorithm parameters.

Highlights include:
* NEW: support for tooltips on hover and selection * The underlying algorithm requires equally spaced time series for the input data * The seasonal factor can be found automatically or set by the user * The choice of each component's additive or multiplicative effect can be found automatically or set by the user R package dependencies (auto-installed): scales, forecast, zoo, ggplot2, htmlWidgets, XML, and plotly are all examples.
